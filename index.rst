   :synopsis: Quick introduction to the command line and bash
.. moduleauthor:: Robin Long <r.long at lancs.ac.uk>

.. highlight:: introduction



This tutorial should give you an overview of how to use linux from the command line.  Its aim is to be brief enough that you can complete it quickly, but comprehensive enough that you can get on and work on the command line.

Each chapter has specific aims stated at the beginning, with a wrap up at the end list the fundamentals.  Each section also has excises that the reader can complete - these should test that you understand what you have learned, not take up your time.


These notes will introduce you to using the command line interface in a Linux/Unix environment, and provide you with the skills needed to login to a remote machine, navigate around the file system,  create files and directories, write simple scripts, and get help from the system.  This will be done across a series of chapter, each containing an overview of the chapter, some key points to take away, and a set of exercise for you to check your understanding of the subject matter.
